# Calculator
Note: If you want to make the calculator's user interface more beautiful, you need to introduce a beautyeye package.I have uploaded it. 

  This project makes a calculator and has a simple user interface for operation. The programming language is implemented through JAVA, including the interface is also implemented through the Java GUI. The idea of programming is mainly through the lexical analysis, grammatical analysis and semantic analysis learned in the compilation principle class. Lexical analysis is implemented by constructing DFA, grammatical analysis uses algorithm-first grammar, and semantic analysis uses inverse Polish.
  
 The Analy class is a grammatical analysis class, the DFA class is a lexical analysis class. The Calculator includes the construction of the interface and the calling process of the main function. The NBLS class is a class that constructs inverse Polish.
 
  This project is open to everyone. If necessary, you can refer to it. If you are convenient, you can say hello to me. I can improve or answer as needed.
